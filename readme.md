ASA plugin for Trac
===================

Consider this an alpha release. I will appreciate all the feedback on the plugin, but please note that it's an early prototype. It may be vulnerable to attacks (e.g., XSS), and therefore is not advisable to make available outside firewalls.

Only tested with sqlite, but it's likely to work with other database engines, namely postgresql.
